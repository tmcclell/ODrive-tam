# Repository Overview

## Repository Purpose

**ODrive-tam** is a fork of the ODrive robotics project, focused on **accurately driving brushless motors affordably**. The main goal is to enable the use of inexpensive brushless motors in high-performance robotics projects.

This is a personal fork (created 1 day ago) from `lifesawesome/ODrive-Custom`, which itself is derived from the original ODrive project by ODrive Robotics.

## Key Features & Components

### 1. **High-Performance Motor Control**
- Precision control of brushless motors for robotics applications
- Designed to make professional-grade motor control accessible and affordable

### 2. **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized into three main sections:

- **Firmware**: ODrive firmware (embedded C++ code)
- **tools**: Python library & command-line tools for controlling ODrive
- **docs**: Documentation
- **GUI**: Graphical user interface (includes JavaScript Fibre bindings)

### 3. **Core Technologies**

- **Fibre**: A communication framework used throughout the project
  - **PyFibre** (Python bindings) - located in `tools/odrive/pyfibre/`
  - **fibre-cpp** (C++ implementation) - located in `Firmware/fibre-cpp/`
  - **fibre-js** (JavaScript bindings) - located in `GUI/fibre-js/`
  - Fibre enables object-oriented distributed systems with RPC (Remote Procedure Call) capabilities

- **Build System**: Uses Tup build system for firmware compilation
  - Dependency-based incremental builds
  - Docker support for containerized builds (via `dockerbuild.sh`)

### 4. **Main Components**

#### **Firmware**
- Written in C++
- Uses doctest for unit testing
- Interface definitions in YAML (`odrive-interface.yaml`)
- Autogenerated code from templates

#### **Python Tools**
- ODrive Python library for device communication
- Command-line utilities (`odrivetool`)
- Test framework (`tools/odrive/tests/`)
- Motion planning utilities (`tools/motion_planning/`)
- Bulk data capture and plotting capabilities

#### **Testing**
- C++ tests using doctest framework
- Python test runner for integration testing
- Test assertions and utilities for validation

## Key Capabilities

1. **Position Control**: Trapezoidal motion planning for smooth position moves
2. **Real-time Data Capture**: Bulk data capture at up to 500 Hz for debugging and analysis
3. **Multi-axis Support**: Support for controlling multiple motor axes
4. **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, Windows (with appropriate USB/UART drivers)

## Building the Project

The repository supports Docker-based builds:

```bash
# Build in Docker container
./dockerbuild.sh build

# Clean up build artifacts
./dockerbuild.sh cleanup

# Remove all build images
./dockerbuild.sh gc
```
